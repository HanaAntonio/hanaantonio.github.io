        • These three sessions of training were attended by non-medical staff at
        GWS Medika. Each session consisted of 15-20 different participants from
        various departments in the head office.
      </p>
      <p align="justify">
        • The sessions started with 30 minutes of presentations and 60 minutes
        of practical sessions.
      </p>
      <p align="justify">
        • During the practical sessions, participants were divided into three
        groups, and there were three posts of different cases, which included
        basic life support and choking, trauma, and evacuation. Participants
        were given 20 minutes for each post. At the post, participants were
        demonstrated by the trainer and supervised to perform each first aid
        procedure.
      </p>

        • Their engagement was truly remarkable, and the positive feedback
        highlighted the value of the hands-on approach. This training
        significantly boosted their emergency response skills and their
        confidence in handling real-life situations. Overall, it was incredibly
        satisfying to see the participants leave with enhanced skills and a
        heightened sense of emergency preparedness.
