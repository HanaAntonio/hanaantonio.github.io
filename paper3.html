      <p><b>Background</b></p>
      <p align="justify">
        • COVID-19 pandemic has been going on for more than one year. To slow
        the spread of transmission and shorten the duration of the pandemic,
        COVID-19 vaccines are required in order to create an immune response
        towards COVID-19 disease and reach herd immunity in a population. The
        economic aspect of the COVID-19 vaccine should be evaluated. This
        literature review was carried out to analyze several economic factors of
        the COVID-19 vaccine.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p><b>Methods</b></p>
      <p align="justify">
        • We searched across several research platforms and included published
        journals that reported economic evaluation of the COVID-19 vaccine,
        specifically about willingness to pay, cost, and financing preferences.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p><b>Results</b></p>
      <p align="justify">
        • The 20 studies included in this data review predominantly used
        cross-sectional online survey as their research method. Most of these
        studies showed that people with moderate to high income have higher
        percentage of willingness to pay, while some others refused to pay with
        a reason that the Government/Insurance should pay the vaccine instead.
      </p>

      <p align="justify">
        • If the vaccine is >80% effective, it was found to be cost saving at
        any cost saving >30%. However, lack of study reported about cost
        effectiveness of the COVID-19 vaccine. Other factor that needs to be
        evaluated is cost/benefit analysis of the COVID-19 vaccine.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p><b>Conclusion</b></p>
      <p align="justify">
        • These evidences suggest that if possible, the Government should fully
        accommodate the COVID-19 vaccination program. However, the Government
        can put charges on moderate to high income people for a single COVID-19
        vaccine. It is suggested to choose a COVID-19 vaccine with high
        effectiveness for cost saving, but a vaccine with limited effectiveness
        found to produce more costs. Further study about cost effectiveness and
        cost/benefit of an ongoing COVID-19 vaccine is recommended.
