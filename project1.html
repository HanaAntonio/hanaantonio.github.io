        This is a Community Development Program provided by our campus to enable
        university students create programs that enhance the development of
        rural areas for two months. The students were able to choose the
        location based on their interest and proposed a program plan for their
        area. I chose Bangka Belitung Islands, specifically in Kemuja Village.
        Itâ€™s located 30 minutes from the capital city of Bangka Belitung
        Islands, Pangkal Pinang.

        Together with my fellow medical students, an agriculture student, and an
        anthropology student, we created several development programs to the
        community. We were divided into 3 groups taking care of several
        subvillages. For agricultural development program, we created a nursery
        garden consisted of holticultural plants, velticulture planting
        technique, encourage elementary students to participate in green school
        environment by planting, also provide some agricultural education by
        cooperating with the local department of agriculture staff.
      </p>
      <p align="justify">
        For medical development program, we cooperated with the local health
        team to do health check up, blood donor, homevisits to do health
        screening, observed the local primary care health system, and also did
        health education to elementary students about hand hygiene.We also
        participated in several social activities as a part of anthropological
        and social program. This two months community program opened our mind to
        use our knowledges and skill to build the community, also enabled us to
        work with interdisciplinary professions.
