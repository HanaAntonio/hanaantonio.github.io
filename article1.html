        The COVID-19 pandemic has been started for more than one year. This
        prolonged pandemic situation and new variants of the new coronavirus
        that might not be detected through PCR testing, spread faster and more
        dangerous, and the possibility that new vaccines are needed, creates new
        anxiety and speculations that impacts on healthcare workers (HCWs)
        mental health too.
      </p>
      <p align="justify">
        With long hours shifts, overwhelming pressure, underpaid, no or late
        incentives, trust issues and rumors circulating about HCWs, risk of
        developing physical and emotional distress, especially among medical
        HCWs (doctor, nurse) at hospital settings is higher than the non medical
        HCWs. A systematic review on PubMed Journal stated that 63% of HCWs
        reported a mental disturbance regarding anxiety, stress, and depression.
        Also, medical staff at the hospital experienced moderate and severe fear
        which was significantly higher than the administrative staff group.
        Working in high incidence of infection also impacts on psychological
        problem and stress level among HCWs.

      <p align="justify">
        <b>How to manage our mental health as healthcare workers?</b>
        <br />
        As HCWs, we are used to face a lot of pressure and high workloads, also
        low quality of sleep due to multiple shifts per week. We often work at
        more than one hospital due to shortage of medical staffs.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p align="justify">
        <i
          >However, this COVID-19 pandemic is a long run. We should maintain our
          pace and keep our health to give a better service to the community.</i
        >
      </p>
      <br />
      <p align="justify">
        A rapid review from BMJ stated that there are several factors to protect
        HCWs mental health. First, is adequate support from work environment.
        Also, equip HCWs with adequate trainings and PPE. Support from the
        family, their loved ones also important, and safety of the family
        members decreases HCWs anxiety and fear.
      </p>
      <p align="justify">
        Another intervention that can be done is providing professional
        psychological support for those who suffers emotionally and
        psychologically. Reducing working hours, providing access to healthy
        meals and hydration, giving incentives to those who work in high risk of
        infection area, besides equipping them with PPE, are equally important
        to protect HCWs mental health. The last is start using telemedicine,
        online video conference such as zoom, to reduce the risk of infections
        among HCWs and reduce HCWs workload. Therefore, they can optimize their
        time to take care of patients and able to maintain their health as well.

          health is equally important as physical health. Stay safe.</i
