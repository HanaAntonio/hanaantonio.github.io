        I had the chance to experience live-in program at one of the rural areas
        in West Borneo, Indonesia. It took 5 hours from the capital city,
        Pontianak to the Serukam, the place where I stayed for one week. I
        educated the local children about hygiene and healthy diet.
      </p>
      <p align="justify">
        We also created several competitions to increase their interest in
        healthy lifestyle. I also observed the hospital system and introduced to
        the hospital service and programs. At the end of the program, we made
        hand craft together as the souvenir for the local kids, also as an
        environmental campaign.

      <h3>Community and Family Heath Care Education Program</h3>

        We have an initiation program from the campus to involve in the
        community health. This program started from our second to fourth year of
        medical school. We were assigned to observe a subvillage and divide it
        into several teams to monitor 2-3 households.
      </p>
      <p align="justify">
        We then proposed several programs to improve health and prevent
        non-communicable disease in the community. Together with fellow nursing
        and nutritional science student I led the health education campaign and
        did home visits routinely to monitor health conditions of each family
        member of that household.
      </p>
      <p align="justify">
        At the end of the preclinical year, we were involved in disaster
        management and emergency training, involving the local villagers, also
        the Regional Board for Disaster Management to educate the villagers
        about basic disaster management and planning, as this village is located
        near the active volcanic mount, Mount Merapi. We also had a disaster
        simulation in that area. This program then transferred to our juniors to
        maintain the continuous health prevention program in the community.
